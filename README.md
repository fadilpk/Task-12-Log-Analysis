# Task 12: Log Monitoring & Analysis

**Name:** Mohammed Fadil PK
**Date:** February 3, 2026

## 📄 Project Description
This project focuses on **Security Log Analysis**. I simulated an authentication attack on a Linux system and analyzed the resulting logs to identify the intrusion attempts. I also audited Windows Security logs using Event Viewer.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Kali Linux:** `ssh` (to simulate attack), `journalctl` (to analyze logs).
* **Windows:** Event Viewer (Security Log).

## 🔍 Key Activities
1.  **Attack Simulation:** Performed a manual SSH brute-force attempt against localhost.
2.  **Log Detection:** Used CLI tools to filter and identify "Failed password" events.
3.  **Windows Auditing:** Navigated Windows Event Viewer to inspect authentication events (Event IDs 4624/4625).

## 📂 Files Included
* `Task12_Log_Analysis_Report.pdf` - Documentation of findings and screenshots.
